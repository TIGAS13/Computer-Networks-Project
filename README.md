This project aims to utilize sockets programming to develop an experimental prototype
of the ESF platform.
The ESF platform intends to be an innovative solution by the OE-RC, designed as a
web portal integrated with mobile applications. Its goal is to connect engineers and
engineering students interested in volunteering with Non-Profit Organizations facing
challenges in various fields of engineering.
